                <p>
                    I'm <strong>Umer Khan</strong>, a Shopify Developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience
                    building and customizing
                    ecommerce stores for fashion, textile, and retail brands. My focus is on creating high-performance,
                    conversion-optimized Shopify solutions that drive real business results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I've worked directly with clients to transform their vision into fully
                    functional
                    online stores. From custom theme development to complex Liquid programming, I specialize in
                    delivering
                    clean, maintainable code that enhances both user experience and store performance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My expertise lies in <strong>theme customization</strong>, <strong>Liquid development</strong>, and
                    implementing
                    <strong>business-driven ecommerce solutions</strong>. I've successfully shipped projects for
                    established brands
                    like Polawn, HzTextilex, and Fareeha by Tassels, handling everything from responsive design
                    implementation
                    to seamless third-party app integrations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What sets me apart is my <strong>problem-solving approach</strong> and commitment to <strong>clean
                        UI implementation</strong>.
                    I don't just build stores—I create scalable solutions that grow with the business. Whether it's
                    optimizing
                    site speed, customizing checkout flows, or building custom sections from scratch, I ensure every
                    line of
                    code serves a purpose.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm passionate about staying current with Shopify's evolving ecosystem, continuously learning new
                    features,
                    and applying best practices to deliver exceptional results. My goal is to help ecommerce businesses
                    succeed
                    by providing reliable, professional Shopify development services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new web technologies, studying ecommerce trends, and finding ways
                    to
                    improve the online shopping experience.
